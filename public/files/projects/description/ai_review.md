During my course of AI at UQAC, I had the opportunity to write a review on AI specific subject. We choose, with a group of two others students, to work on procedural generation, particularly in the game development industry.

We read around _20 articles_, books and thesis on this subject in order to write a _short five pages review_. This project was really formative as It was necessary to retain only the essentials while providing a general overview of the problem and a coherent development of the proposals and articles.

In this review we have discussed several topics and applications of procedural generation mainly in aesthetics and game mechanics, while at the same time reviewing the state of the art and stating the current limits of the technology.
