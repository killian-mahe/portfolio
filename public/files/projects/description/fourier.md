This project aims to apply the Fourier transform to drawing. This web application decomposes the user's drawing into a series of circles of different sizes modelling the amplitudes and frequencies of the components obtained during the decomposition. Once the drawing is decomposed, the application redraws the work by summing the periodic signals.
